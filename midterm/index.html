        <p>Itten's studies at the Bern-Hofwil Teachers' Academy with Ernst Schnider proved seminal for his later work as a master at the Bauhaus.</p>

        <p>Itten adopted principles espoused by Schnider, including the practice of not correcting his students' creative work on an individual basis, for fear that this would crush the creative impulse. rather, he selected the certain common mistaked to correct for the class as a whole.</p>

        <h1>1912</h1>
        <p>In 1912, he returned to Geneva, where he studied under Eugene Giliard, an abstract painter.</p>

        <p>Itten opened a private school in Vienna using the work and textbook of Eugene Giliard as a base. From Holzel, Itten adopted a series of basic shapes (the line, the plane, the curcle, the spiral) as a means from which to begin creation, and the use of gymnastic excercises to relax his students and prepare them for the experiences that where to occur in the class.</p>
