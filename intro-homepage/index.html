        <p>Ever heard of Scorigami? It refers to two teams in American football (although the term has been used in other sports) creating a final score that is unique in the sense that it has never been recorded in NFL history. The term was created by Jon Bois in 2016 and since its inception every Scorigami has been recorded <a href="https://nflscorigami.com/">on the official Scorigami website.</a> Also, Bois has a wonderful video on the history of these phenomena.</p>

Someone with aphantasia would most likely be unable to close their eyes and visualize the facial features of a close friend of family member. The relatively unstudied phenomenon was first described in a paper by polymath Francis Galton in 1880, but interest has been renewed in the topic by a <a href="https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/bitstream/handle/10871/17613/Lives%20without%20imagery%20Letter%20version%20FINAL%2017.5.15%20.pdf?sequence=7">2015 study (the first to give the condition a name)</a> by Adam Zemen, Michaela Dewar and Sergio Della Sala. </p>
